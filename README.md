# Welcome to JSCLI!

Hi! Ever found yourself wondering why your download folder is bloated? Everything is all over the place? This happened to me countless times. **JSCLI** is a small tool that can help you sort the mess. I build this small cli tool with javascript which can move your files in the directory to designated folders.

# How to use?

- Navigate to desired directory
- Use the following command
  'Tool --start'
- Done!
